# Adam Rifai's Personal Website

A simple, responsive personal website showcasing my coding journey, projects, and a way to get in touch. Built with HTML and CSS, this project serves as my digital playground to share my work and interests.

## Features

- **Multi-Page Structure**: Home (with coding history), Projects, and Contact pages.
- **Responsive Navbar**: Profile image on the left, navigation links on the right.
- **Coding Focus**: Highlights my coding start, favorite languages (Python, JavaScript, C++), and a "Hello, World!" snippet with images.
- **Static Contact Form**: Placeholder form (to be connected to a service like Formspree later).
- **Visuals**: Includes a code screenshot, Python logo, and workspace photo.
- **Social Links**: Footer with Twitter, LinkedIn, and GitHub icons.

## Installation

1. **Clone or Download**:

   - Clone this repo: `git clone https://github.com/adamrifai/your-repo.git` (replace with your GitHub URL if hosted).
   - Or download the ZIP and extract it.

2. **Open Locally**:

   - Open `index.html` in a browser (e.g., double-click or drag into Chrome).

3. **Images**:
   - Replace `login.jpg`, `first-code.jpg`, and `workspace.jpg` with your own photos.
   - Source `python-logo.png` from [python.org](https://www.python.org/community/logos/) or a free icon site.

## Usage

- **Home Page**: Learn about my coding journey and tech interests.
- **Projects Page**: Browse sample projects (customize with your own).
- **Contact Page**: Static form—fill in details for now; see "Future Improvements" to make it functional.
- Navigate using the top navbar or "Back to Home" buttons.

## Technologies

- **HTML5**: Structure and content.
- **CSS3**: Styling with Flexbox for layout and responsiveness.
- **Font Awesome**: Social media icons in the footer.

## Customization

- **Personal Info**: Edit `index.html` (e.g., coding history, location, fun fact), `projects.html` (project list), and `contact.html` (email).
- **Images**: Swap placeholders (`login.jpg`, etc.) with your own.
- **Styles**: Tweak `styles.css` (e.g., colors `#2c3e50` and `#f4f4f4`, font sizes).
- **Form**: Add Formspree or another service to `contact.html` (see below).

## Future Improvements

- **Functional Contact Form**: Integrate Formspree (`<form action="https://formspree.io/f/{id}" method="POST">`) to send emails.
- **JavaScript**: Add interactivity (e.g., form validation, navbar animations).
- **More Pages**: Expand with a "Blog" or "Skills" page.
- **Responsive Tweaks**: Test and refine for smaller screens (e.g., adjust `gap` in `.navbar`).
