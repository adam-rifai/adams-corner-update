      <h2>Home</h2>
      <p>
        Hey there! I’m Adam Rifai, a coder who’s been hooked on programming
        since I wrote my first line of code in middle school. This site is my
        digital workshop—where I tinker with code, share my projects, and nerd
        out about all things tech. Whether you’re here to see what I’ve built or
        chat about algorithms, I’m stoked you’re here!
      </p>
      <p>
        My coding journey kicked off with HTML and CSS back in 2015, messing
        around with basic web pages in Notepad. Since then, I’ve dived into
        Python, JavaScript, and a bit of C++, building everything from a
        text-based adventure game to this very website. I love how coding lets
        me solve puzzles and create something out of nothing—check out my latest
        work on the
        <a href="projects.html">Projects page</a>!

        <h3>Popular Languages I’ve Explored</h3>
        <p>
          The coding world’s full of awesome tools—here’s my take on a few big
          ones:

            <img src="python-logo.png" alt="Python Logo" class="lang-icon" />
            <strong>Python</strong>: My go-to for quick scripts and messing with
            data. It’s simple, powerful, and got me hooked on coding for real.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>JavaScript</strong>: The king of the web—I used it to make
            this site interactive. It’s chaotic but I love it.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>C++</strong>: Tried this for a game prototype in high
            school. Tough to learn, but it taught me how computers really think.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Tech Snapshot</h3>
        <p>
          Right now, I’m deep into learning React to level up my web skills. My
          toolkit includes VS Code, GitHub, and a trusty Terminal—I’m always
          chasing the next bug to squash or feature to ship. Got a coding
          question? Hit me up on the

      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I’m Adam, a Seattle-based developer who lives for the thrill of writing
        code that works. From debugging at 2 a.m. to seeing a project go live,
        it’s all about that rush. When I’m not glued to my screen, you’ll catch
        me brewing coffee or hiking the trails around Puget Sound. My coding
        adventures are over on the Projects page—take a peek!
      </p>
      <p>
        Fun fact: My first program was a Python script that crashed my old
        laptop—it was a mess, but I was hooked. This site’s my playground, built
        from scratch to share my love for code.
